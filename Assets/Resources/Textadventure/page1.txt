You find yourself in a deserted subway station. 
Yet, you appear to have no recollection of how you got here whatsoever - did you hit your head? 
It's the middle of the night, judging by the sign telling you that the last ride home passed mere minutes ago. 
You're also freezing, which angers you, as if dealing with the utter absence of daylight wasn't enough.
A flickering beacon barely lights up two hallways in front of you - which one do you take?
